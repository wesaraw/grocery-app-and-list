# Grocery Price Checker

This is a simple browser add-on that helps you find and compare prices for grocery items.
It is written for people who are new to computers, so the instructions below are very
step‑by‑step.

## What this add-on does

* Shows a list of groceries you may want to buy.
* Lets you open a store page to see prices (for example, "Stop & Shop").
* After the page opens, the add-on collects product information so you can pick the
  option you prefer.
* Remembers which store you chose for each item.
* Shows how much you might need to buy next to each item.
* Lets you save the final product you want with its picture and price.
* Can create a shopping list and update your pantry when you press **Commit**.
* Allows you to edit your pantry and how much you have used.
* Lets you add new grocery items to track.

5. When the page finishes loading, switch back to the small window. You will see a
   list of products from that store. Click **Select** next to the product you want.

   the item. The add-on remembers your choice.
